# Platform Documentation

Origin Cloud™ helps organizations construct and manage their digital identity — and use that identity to improve efficiency and build reputation. Origin™ is rooted in world-class cryptography and cybersecurity. However, it translates that rigor into simple business processes that anyone can understand.

Orgs are built by and from people. Origin therefore includes many features that help individuals in team interactions, including delegation, credentials, wallets, agents, and governance frameworks.

Origin is operated commercially by [Provenant](https://provenant.net)™ and its partners. However, it is built atop [open source technologies](https://github.com/WebOfTrust), can be extended via that open source, and supports low-friction interactions with participants in the ecosystem who don't use Origin.&#x20;

Which features of Origin are most relevant to you depends on your perspective.

* If you belong to an org that needs to consume Origin features, see [Clients](x/clients.md).
* If you belong to an org that uses Origin to deliver value-added identity features to others, see [Service Providers](x/sps/).
* If you're a developer who wants to create services on Origin, see [Developers](x/developers.md).
