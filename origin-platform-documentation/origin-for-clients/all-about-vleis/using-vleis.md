# Using vLEIs

Here are some ways to use vLEI credentials:

* You can present them to remote parties to prove things about your organization or yourself. (In Origin's Hold view, select Present.)
* You can [act as a verifier](https://github.com/GLEIF-IT/vlei-verifier), confirming the validity of and the data within the vLEIs of others.&#x20;
* In an interaction, you can use them to prove that your organization and/or people with specific roles in your organization are participating.
* You can use them in conjunction [with ordinary digital signatures](what-it-means-to-sign-with-a-vlei.md#simple-mode) on files, email attachments, social media posts, and similar things.
* You can use them to sign XBRL for regulatory compliance purposes. See the XBRL signing application on Origin.
* You can associate them with your [SPF/DKIM/DMARC](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/) solution to increase the security of your corporate email solution.
* You can create and issue [new credential types](https://github.com/provenant-dev/public-schema), and chain them to your vLEIs.

Today, many of these operations require custom code to be written, because shrink-wrapped products with the right features are still being developed. We expect the ecosystem to mature rapidly in coming months. Ask your QVI or another service provider for help.\
