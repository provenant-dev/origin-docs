# Using vLEIs

Here are some things you can do with vLEI credentials:

* You can present them to remote parties. This can prove properties of your organization (e.g., its LEI or its cryptographic identifier), or properties of people associated with your organization (e.g., their name, their role, their cryptographic identifier).
* You can sign cryptographic messages, proving that your organization and/or people with specific roles in your organization are parties to an interaction.
* You can use them in conjunction with ordinary digital signatures on files.
* You can use them to sign XBRL. XBRL is a data format required by government regulators in various jurisdictions.
* You can create and issue new credential types, and chain them to your vLEIs.

In casual language, people might say that they want a vLEI so they can sign with it. It is true (and important!) that you can use a vLEI in conjunction with digital signatures, but it's important to understand some nuances.
