# Using vLEIs

Here are some ways to use vLEI credentials:

* You can present them to remote parties to prove things about your organization or yourself.
* In an interaction, you can use them to prove that your organization and/or people with specific roles in your organization are participating.
* You can use them in conjunction with ordinary digital signatures on files, email attachments, social media posts, and similar things.
* You can use them to sign XBRL for regulatory compliance purposes.
* You can associate them with your SPF/DKIM/DMARC solution to increase the security of your corporate email solution.
* You can create and issue new credential types, and chain them to your vLEIs.

Today, many of these operations require custom code to be written, because shrink-wrapped products with the right features are still being developed. We expect the ecosystem to mature rapidly in coming months. Ask your QVI or another service provider for help.\
