# Origin for clients

A client is an org that uses Origin to create, manage, and derive business value from a formal digital identity. Some of the things that clients do with Origin include:

* Receive [digital credentials](../../glossary.md#digital-credential) from service providers who provide vetting and support. For example, you might use Origin to [get a vLEI](all-about-vleis/the-vlei-journey.md).
* Design and issue credentials that match its unique use cases.
* Formally delegate and revoke authority to people and other orgs affiliated with the client.
* Assign, coordinate, and audit the activities of delegates.
* Use received and issued credentials and delegation relationships to generate publicly verifiable evidence that the org is authentically responsible for its business activities. Fraudsters are incapable of producing such evidence. This allows the client and its representatives to file reports with regulators, issue invoices, participate in supply chains, send SMS and VOIP and email traffic, post on social media, sign contracts, and many other things with dramatically improved reputation and drastically reduced risk of phishing, deep fakes, or social engineering.

### Getting Started

Any person affiliated with an org can create a free account on Origin. This gives them a free personal wallet and the ability to hold and issue [certain credentials](https://github.com/provenant-dev/public-schema/blob/main/face-to-face/index.md). It also allows them to invite colleagues to join for free, and to collaborate to build a free profile for their org.

However, the email verification that's part of onboarding an individual provides little assurance that the individual is _authorized_, or that their org actually _wants to use_ the platform. Therefore, a common next step is to establish a relationship with a [facilitator](../../glossary.md#facilitator). This is a [service provider](../../glossary.md#service-provider) that guides the client through its foundational identity work and provides support on (and perhaps off) Origin.

To find a facilitator for your org, run a web search or consult the [Service Provider Directory](service-provider-directory.md).
