# PII

Origin is primarily focused on the problem of organizational identity. The data that it stores and helps you to share is primarily about organizations.

However, organizations consist of people, and in a limited way, Origin has to connect the two. As a result, Origin does deal with a small amount of PII, such as the names and email email addresses of employees.

For more information about this topic, see [PII on Origin](https://files.origincloud.net/std/pii.pdf).
